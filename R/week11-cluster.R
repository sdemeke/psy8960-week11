##Answers to Questions
#1. Which models benefited most from moving to the supercomputer and why?
#

#2. What is the relationship between time and the number of cores used?

#3. If your supervisor asked you to pick a model for use in a production model, would you recommend using the supercomputer and why? Consider all four tables when providing an answer.
